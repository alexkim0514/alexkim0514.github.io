            <h5>Stem Fair Engineering Design Process</h5>
            <h6>Ask : People works for city. Because of that, people have a lot of problems such as labors working time or accident.
                To solve, this we decided to reduce working time, so we use AI Robot in the city</h6>
            <h6>Imagine : To solve, we decided using robot. And I focused on making car. First, I made a car frame using vex ex; education.
                Next, I used code program for vex exp. I made a code to move vex exp.</h6>
            <h6>Plan : First, I draw approximately car in paper. Using that, I made a frame of car using vex And I put my code into my car</h6>
            <h6>Create : I create a car which move automatically by remote control. Infront of car, there are two distance sensor. It can detect if the distence car and other object is close</h6>
            <h6>Improve :  It is hard to make with mystibil initial design.
                So, I made car without my design, but my then my car is so week. So that , I fixed it.</h6>
            <h6>Team Good. We made a poster. Ku, Kim, Jenny made a poster and Key Jenny made a aty desgn
                and I made a Car.</h6>
